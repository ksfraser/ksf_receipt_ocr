This is a MS Copilot rough draft.

Known issues:
	Hooks.php does not have all the needed parts.
	Some of the processing looks to be hallucinations
	Has it's own db code instead of using FA calls
	Code can be refactored so that internal related stuff uses internal
		*vendor lookup
		*creating purchase orders and payments.

This could also be integrated with the Bank Import code.  These receipts should
match the bank transactions.  the Bank Import code could look for existing uploaded
receipts.  This module could "stage" the POs, payments.  Or, this module creates the
vendor POs, Bank Import matches and creates the Vendor Payment.
